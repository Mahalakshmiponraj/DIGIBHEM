Contact Management System

Load Contacts: Reads contacts from a JSON file if it exists, or returns an empty list if not.
Save Contacts: Saves the contacts list to a JSON file.
Add Contact: Allows the user to add a new contact by entering name, phone, and email.
View Contacts: Displays the list of contacts.
Edit Contact: Allows the user to edit an existing contact.
Delete Contact: Allows the user to delete a contact.
Main Loop: Presents a menu to the user and executes the corresponding function based on user input.
This code will create a file named contacts.json in the same directory to store the contact information. You can run the program, add contacts, view them, edit them, and delete them, and the changes will be saved to the file.
